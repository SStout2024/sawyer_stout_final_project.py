Simple overview of use/purpose.

Description
An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use.
I plan to create a game that resembles Monaco Grand Prix. I will make other cars as mobs and have them randomly spawn. If the player hits a car they restart. I will possibly add a healthbar so instead of restarting on one crash, you will have a few crashes to restart. There will be a score increase every time you pass a car. There will be speed boosts and a score increase every speed boost. coins will increase points. Control using left and right arrows.
