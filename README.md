This is Sawyer Stout's final project in Intro to Computer Programming.

Description
An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use.
I plan to create a game that adds on to my doodle jump game in the previous github submission. I added mobs, defs, classes, ending screen and beginning screen. If the player hits a mob or falls off the screen, the game is over and offers them another chance to play.
